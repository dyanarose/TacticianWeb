The state of the authorised endpoints has gotten interesting.

This past week ArenaNet has released the character information endpoint. It's not "complete" but it's a very interesting start.

Right now the available information is: 
--show own character examples
* Characters on an account
* Individual character information - Name, race, gender, level, profession, guild (assuming this is the current rep guild)

Not a great amount of info, no, but it's a start, and the furture of the endpoint looks very good:
* inventory
* skills
* traits
* equipment

I expect a number of applications will be quickly turning around updates to take advantage of this new information, from tracker apps and trading post apps, to apps that can use the basic information to create say, a gravatar for Guild Wars 2.
