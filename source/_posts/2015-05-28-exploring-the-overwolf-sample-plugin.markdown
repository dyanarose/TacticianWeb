A [request](http://forums.overwolf.com/index.php?/topic/5587-plugin-development-tutorial/) came up recently on the Overwolf forums for a tutorial on creating NPAPI plugins.
<!--more-->
Out of that, I've started a [write up of the sample NPAPI plugin](https://github.com/dyanarose/overwolf-sample-plugin-documentation) that Overwolf provides to help pull together information on the implementation and scripting resources.

Hopefully it's helpful and all errors or misunderstandings get pull requests.
